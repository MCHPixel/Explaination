## Important Notice
* Ok so first of all on the list this is optional but i wanted to help you so, here you go so a little tutorial with Pictures they will be marked with a ~ and a number so like this ~1

## Explaination
* Ok so first off all im gonna explain on the start is which software to use and how they will affect in different cases!

Here are all Software types and thier pros an cons:

# 1. Spigot

## Pros:

Performance: Optimized for performance, making it suitable for large servers with many players.
Compatibility: Widely used and highly compatible with Bukkit plugins.
Community Support: Strong community with extensive documentation and a wide range of plugins.
Customization: Allows for significant customization through configuration files and plugin use.

## Cons:

Updates: Can sometimes lag behind Minecraft updates, causing a delay in compatibility with new versions.
Complexity: May require more technical knowledge to set up and configure optimally.



# 2. Paper

## Pros:

Performance: Even more optimized than Spigot, with additional performance improvements and better handling of high player counts.
Compatibility: Fully compatible with Spigot and Bukkit plugins.
Advanced Features: Offers additional configuration options and features not found in Spigot, useful for server administrators.
Community Support: Active community and strong developer support.


## Cons:

Updates: Like Spigot, may experience delays in updating to new Minecraft versions.
Complexity: Advanced configuration options can be overwhelming for beginners.



# 3. Bukkit

## Pros:

Ease of Use: User-friendly and easy to set up, making it suitable for beginners.
Compatibility: Large selection of plugins specifically designed for Bukkit.
Documentation: Extensive documentation and resources available.

## Cons:

Performance: Less optimized for performance compared to Spigot and Paper.
Development: No longer actively developed, which means fewer updates and new features.
Support: Smaller community compared to Spigot and Paper.



## Conclusion
For plugin-based servers with a focus on performance, Paper is generally the best option.
For a more modded experience, Forge or Fabric are preferred, depending on your performance needs and the specific mods you want to use.
Spigot is a solid choice if you need a balance of performance and plugin support but do not need the extra features of Paper.
Sponge is ideal if you want to run a server that supports both mods and plugins, though it may be more complex to set up.
