# Proxies
These are used to connect your Servers together to a Network. Just like Hypixel and all the big servers out there.

# BungeeCord


Overview:

BungeeCord is a proxy server system designed to link multiple Minecraft servers together, allowing players to connect to any server in the network seamlessly.


Pros:

* Widely Used: Very popular in the Minecraft community, leading to extensive documentation and support.
* Plugin Support: A vast array of plugins available due to its popularity.
* Stable: Well-tested over many years with a large user base.


Cons:

* Performance: Not the most efficient in handling high traffic and large networks compared to newer solutions.
* Security: Has had security vulnerabilities in the past, though most have been patched.


Status:

* Maintained: Yes, BungeeCord is still actively maintained by the Spigot team and the community.



# Velocity


Overview:

Velocity is a newer Minecraft proxy built to be fast, reliable, and secure. It aims to provide a better experience for both server administrators and players.


Pros:

* Performance: Highly optimized for better performance, especially under heavy loads.
* Security: Strong focus on security and avoiding common vulnerabilities found in older proxies.
* Simplicity: Clean and straightforward API for developers.


Cons:

* Plugin Ecosystem: Smaller plugin ecosystem compared to BungeeCord, though growing steadily.
* Newer: Less tested in extreme scenarios due to being a newer project.


Status:

* Maintained: Yes, Velocity is actively developed and maintained, with a strong emphasis on performance and security.

# Waterfall


Overview:

Waterfall is a fork of BungeeCord that focuses on performance, stability, and security improvements.


Pros:

* Performance: Offers enhanced performance and stability over the original BungeeCord.
* Compatibility: Retains compatibility with BungeeCord plugins.
* Security: Features better security measures compared to BungeeCord.


Cons:

* BungeeCord Dependency: While it improves upon BungeeCord, it still inherits some of its limitations.
* Smaller Community: Has a smaller user base compared to BungeeCord.


Status:

* Not Maintained: As of recent developments, Waterfall is no longer actively maintained.


### Summary
* BungeeCord: Still actively maintained, widely used, but may have some performance limitations.
* Velocity: Actively maintained, focuses on performance and security, growing plugin ecosystem.
* Waterfall: Not actively maintained, though it offered improvements over BungeeCord when it was supported.
Given the current status, if you're looking for a proxy with active support and updates, BungeeCord or Velocity would be better choices over Waterfall.
